STEP A 
 remove new line character \n from end of md5sum (over 1,400,000 entries) in database bk2501a.db3 (copy of bk2501.db3)
 execute to get list:
  SELECT md5sum, length(md5sum) as title_length
  FROM blubackup
   WHERE length(md5sum) > 32;
         1418239 rows
 execute to do removal:
  UPDATE blubackup
  SET md5sum=replace(md5sum, CHAR(10), '');
 write changes.

STEP 1
  create csv with vertical bar separator from backup database;
Execute:

      sqlite3 bk2501a.db3  < dumpbk2501a.sql 2> dumpbk2501amess.txt

where  dumpbk2501.sql is

    .headers on 
    .mode csv
    .separator | 
    .output bk2501dump.csv 
    select * from blubackup;
    .quit

STEP 2
the dump file has rows with no md5sum and some have a " as a first character
need to run 
./target/release/bkcleanmd5sum bk2501adump.csv
this creates a file goodout01.excout

STEP 3
sort the goodout01.excout by the md5sum value high to low so the header is at the top.
sort --field-separator='|' --key=6r --output=bk202501adumpsorted.csv < goodout01.excout

STEP 4
run hdbkmd5sum on a harddrive. i.e. Videos.hdlist

STEP 5
sort the Videos.hdlist by the md5sum value high to low so the header is at the top.
sort --field-separator='|' --key=6r --output=Videossorted.csv < Videos.hdlist

STEP 6
create file cattop with data: refname|filename|dirname|filesize|filedate|md5sum|locations|notes
cat cattop bk202501adumpsorted.csv > bk202501adscat.csv
create file cattop1 with data: filename|filesize|filedate|dirname|refname|md5sum|locations|notes
cat cattop1 Videossorted.csv > Videossortedcat.csv

STEP 7
reads Videossortedcat.csv and bk202501dscat.csv to see if it is backed up.
example:
./target/release/bkhdflatcomp01 bk202501dscat.csv Videossortedcat.csv exclude.excfile nnnn
   where nnnn is an optional input to read the hdinitsorted.csv starting at nnnn row
runs extremely fast. 300000 files in .1 min. vs. using database takes over 8 min.
inputs:
sorted backup csv, sorted hd csv, exclude list, starting row (optional)

outputs:
hdref, filename, hddir, hdsize, hddate, hdmd5sum, line number
    more than 1 backup
    just 1 backup
    no backup
    excluded

STEP 8
COPY HD FILES IN ARE FOR BACKUP
taking the above hdref files (no backup and just 1 backup)
review the list  
and run the RUST-ICED program hdcopy4bkup
input: no backup
output: directory to store copy of file
